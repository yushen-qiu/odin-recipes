        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <p>This 4-ingredient orange chicken made with frozen chicken tenders is great for when you’re craving takeout. It’s so simple to make at home, is very budget-friendly, and only takes 4 ingredients. I serve it over rice, topped with green onions and sesame seeds.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup orange marmalade</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Kansas City-style BBQ sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 (1 pound) bag frozen fully cooked chicken nuggets</li>
            <li>Sliced green onions (optional)</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds (optional)</li>
        </ul>
          
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place frozen nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until hot and crispy, 11 to 13 minutes, or according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk marmalade, BBQ sauce, and soy sauce together in a small saucepan and heat over low heat until hot, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place nuggets in a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over the top. Toss to coat.</li>
        </ol>
